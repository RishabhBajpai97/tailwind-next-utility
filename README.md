# tailwind-next-utility
This is a tailwind and next utility I created in order to avoid reinstalling and adding tailwind over and over in new next projects. Its still a work in progress but here is the first version. Folow these steps and this utility will be installed globally on your system.
Just use npx tailwind-next-utility after installing next and voila....you are done installing tailwind.
